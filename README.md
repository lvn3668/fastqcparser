# fastqcparser
Python code to compute adatper content in reads, kmer content, per-base-GC content (at a specific position in a read alignment, against reference genome), per base NC content (at a specific position in a read alignment against the reference genome), per base seq quality (across aligned reads), per base sequence content, per base quality scores, per tile sequence quality
